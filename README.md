# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

For this project I wrote the javascript to generate a random password.

# conditions
  when Generate password is clicked a window prompt will ask how many characters.  It will only accept numbers between 8-128
   
   After the amount of characters is chosen a series of confirms will ask if you need lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols.  ok marks them true, cancel marks them false
   
   Once all the perameters are set a password will be generated in the text area that meets the criteria.
